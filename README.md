# Core Tasks

## 1. SMILES to 3D Geometry: Use RDKit to convert SMILES strings into XYZ files with 3D geometries

## 2. Manual DFT Example: Perform a static DFT calculation on a small molecule (eg., ethanol) using ORCA with polarizability enabled. Learn input syntax and job submission.

## 3. Parsing the Output: Write python scripts to extract HOMO-LUMO gaps and polarizability tensors using cclib

## 4. Automation: Build a script that reads a list of SMILES, generates input files, runs calculations, parses output, and stores results in a local database.

## 5. Data Management: Store computed descriptors along with SMILES, calculation parameters, and output metadata (methods used, runtime, etc.)
